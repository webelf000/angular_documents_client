This module is supposed to be used in a walhall app and after running midgard schematics with a configuration that includes this module, the module will be cloned under the projects directory

## Development server

In your walhall application run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

In your walhall application run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

In your walhall application run `ng test documents` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

In your walhall application run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
